<h1>soccer</h1>
<p><h4>Ever since I was a little kid I had alwasy loved to play soccer. I remember the frist time that I socred a goal the felling that I gave me was pure joy
The lesson that soccer though me was that you have to work as a team becuase if you dont then everything you do
will be for nothing and you will lose.

<h1>Music/clerinet</h1>
<p><h4>The reason that I got into music was becuase of my dad he plays the trombone and got me into playing the clerieg

work better with other baouse you have to follow eachother when you play
